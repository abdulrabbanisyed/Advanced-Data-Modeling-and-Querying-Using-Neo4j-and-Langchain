# Graph Database Project with Langchain and Neo4j

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Neo4j, a leading graph database, and Langchain, a library for natural language processing, to manage and query a dataset of movies. By leveraging graph database technology, this project illustrates how to efficiently store and retrieve complex relationships between data entities.

## The 1000 nodes created by langchain on Neo4J graphDB.

## Objective:
- To showcase the integration of Neo4j and Langchain for managing a movie dataset.
- To demonstrate the creation of nodes and relationships in a graph database.
- To enable natural language querying of the dataset using Langchain.

## The sample relationship visualization of GraphDB with their nodes of the respective data.

## Skills Utilized
- **Graph Databases:**  Proficiency in Neo4j for storing and querying data.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Utilizing Langchain to interpret and process natural language queries.
- **Python Programming:** Writing scripts to interface with Neo4j and Langchain.
- **Data Modeling:** Designing and implementing a graph data model for the movie dataset.

## Technologies Used
- **Neo4j:** A powerful graph database used for storing and managing nodes and relationships of the data.
- **Langchain:** A library for processing natural language queries and interfacing with database.
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for scripting and data manipulation.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive environment for developing and showcasing the project.

## Key Features
- **Node and Relationship Creation:** Scripts to create nodes (Movies, Actors, Directors, Genres) and relationships (ACTED_IN, IN_GENRE, DIRECTED) in Neo4j.
- **Natural Language Querying:** Using Langchain to process queries like "Who are the actors of the movie 'X'?" and retrieve relevant data from Neo4j.
- **Graph Transformers:** Implementing LLMGraphTransformer from Langchain for enhanced graph-based transformations and queries.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Jupyter Notebook and neo4j to interactively run and showcase the project.

## Results
- **Data Relationships:** Neo4j is particularly useful in domains where understanding and navigating complex relationships is crucial, such as social networks, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs.
- **Natural Language Interface:** Langchain can make data querying more accessible by allowing users to interact with databases using natural language, enhancing user experience and productivity.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval:** Graph databases offer performance advantages in querying highly connected data, making them ideal for applications requiring real-time insights and analytics.
