# Graph Database Project with Langchain and Neo4j

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Neo4j, a leading graph database, and Langchain, a library for natural language processing, to manage and query a dataset of movies. By leveraging graph database technology, this project illustrates how to efficiently store and retrieve complex relationships between data entities.

## Objective:
- To showcase the integration of Neo4j and Langchain for managing a movie dataset.
- To demonstrate the creation of nodes and relationships in a graph database.
- To enable natural language querying of the dataset using Langchain.

## Skills Utilized
- ** Graph Databases:**  Proficiency in Neo4j for storing and querying data.
- ** Natural Language Processing: ** Utilizing Langchain to interpret and process natural language queries.
- ** Python Programming: ** Writing scripts to interface with Neo4j and Langchain.
- ** Data Modeling: ** Designing and implementing a graph data model for the movie dataset.
